<p>The Wall Manager allows users to upload their applications, which 
  can use different platforms, and make them run on the Wall. Since each 
  platform has its own way of launching applications, there is are some 
  specifications you need to be aware of.
</p><h1><span 
class="mw-headline">Specifications </span></h1>
<a name="Zip_Bundle" id="Zip_Bundle"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline"> Zip Bundle </span></h2>
<p>The application should be packed as one zip (application/zip 
mime-type) with all the files inside. This allows a much more simple 
upload and the zip compression makes it fast to do so.
</p>
<a name="Initializer" id="Initializer"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Initializer </span></h2>
<p>The multi-touch computer is running a Windows XP as its operative 
system. A simple way of allowing developers to customize the way their 
application is launched is through a Batch File: a text file with a 
sequence of commands that is executed by the command prompt and a .bat 
extension.
</p><p>This solution has the flexibility of allowing users to write 
their own initialization scripts in other language supported by the wall
 (Python, for instance) by just writing a one-line batch file.
</p>
<a name="Contents" id="Contents"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Contents </span></h2>
<p>You should add your application files to the zip. This includes the 
binaries (C, C++, Java) or the source code (Python) and resources used 
by them (Images, etc...)
</p>
<a name="Structure" id="Structure"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Structure </span></h2>
<p>YourApplication.zip should contain the following files:
</p>
<ul><li> boot.bat (the mandatory initializer)
</li><li> Other files your application requires. 
</li></ul>
<a name="Restrictions" id="Restrictions"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Restrictions </span></h2>
<p>Your application should be self-contained. Except for system 
libraries or provided platforms (such as JDK and MT4J, OpenFrameworks, 
Python and PyMT) all the dependencies of your application should be 
inside your zip file. 
After the zip file is unpacked, your application should only need to 
write in that directory. This makes the uninstall process more 
efficient.
</p>
<a name="Security" id="Security"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Security </span></h2>
<p>Each application is connected to a student's account, and the 
information of what application is being launched is logged and WILL be 
used.
