		There are some details that the developer needs to know, specific 
to the wall, in order to make it run like it's supposed to. This 
section's objective is minimize the amount of unpredicted behaviors 
after the application is deployed, so that the end user experiences it 
the way both the wallmanager team and the users planned it.

class="mw-headline">The Exit Gesture </span></h2>
<p>One of the things you must not forget, is the "reserved" exit method 
the SenseWall has implemented.
</p><p>There are two ways to end an application running on the 
SenseWall:
</p>
<ul><li>1. Each application is expected to have its own quit 
functionality in the usual places: an option in the main menu or a 
button near the screen corners.
</li><li>2. The universal way to end an application is to perform a 
special gesture (the Exit Method) anywhere in the SenseWall screen. This
 gesture will quit the application in every situation, even on freezes 
or crashes, overriding it completely. The quit gesture is: 
</li></ul>

<p><br>
In this sense, <b>it is advised that the programmer doesn't make use of 
this specific gesture (the Exit Method), or another too similar, in 
their own applications.</b>

<a name="Gracefull_Exits" id="Gracefull_Exits"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">Gracefull Exits </span></h2>
<p>The "Exit Method" has already been implemented and made available to 
all running applications. All that's left to ask of developers is to 
make their applications tolerant to failures with a "gracefull exit" so 
as to avoid nasty application crashes.
</p><p>Please read the following link to learn more about "Gracefull 
Exits":

<a name="FullScreen" id="FullScreen"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline">FullScreen </span></h2>
<p>An other thing to remind yourself, is that the wall applications will
 probably run in fullscreen mode. 
</p><p>That is why developers must bear that in mind and make their 
applications ready for running in fullscreen mode on the SenseWall.
</p>
<a name="ScreenSaver_Applications" id="ScreenSaver_Applications"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline"> ScreenSaver Applications </span></h2>
<p>Know that, by submitting an application of the ScreenSaver category 
type, it can be executed in a slightly different way than the usual 
applications.
</p><p>Ideally, by touching an screen saver application it should close.
 However, the developer may want to add interactive elements, like 
dragging or resizing, but the larger majority of the screen saver 
applications should close after a single touch.
</p><p>Who defines what's the current screensaver are the SenseWall 
administrators. If you wish, you can contact him to ask to have your 
screen saver running at the SenseWall for some time. If you're not sure 
how to do it, please read section <strong>Contact Administrator</strong> of the User 
Documentation.

<a name="Folders" id="Folders"></a><h2><span 
class="mw-headline"> Folders </span></h2>
<p>Finally, please make use of the correct folders in your application. 
Namely, please respect the following directives:
</p>
<ul><li> Use the folder that the application will be running for 
temporary files.
</li><li> Use the&nbsp;%USERDATA% folder for permanent data, even after 
application updates.
</li></ul>
